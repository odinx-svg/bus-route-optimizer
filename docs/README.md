# Documentation Index

This folder groups non-runtime documentation to keep the repository root focused on runnable assets.

## Structure

- `docs/setup/`: setup and infrastructure notes.
- `docs/reports/`: analysis, validation, and feedback reports.

## Notes

- `AGENTS.md` stays at repository root by design.
- Runtime scripts (`start*.bat`, `stop*.bat`, etc.) stay at repository root for operator convenience.
